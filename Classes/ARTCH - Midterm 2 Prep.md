	- Flanders: Peter Paul Rubens (pg 741)
		- Elevation of the Cross, 1610
		- I find that Rubens implemented Caravaggio's stye in this work by incorporating the dramatic lighting (tenebrism) all the while keeping a more classical approach to models and colors.
	- France: Georges de La Tour (pg 766)
		- Adoration of the Sheperds, 1645-1650
		- I find that Georges de La Tour implemented Caravaggio's style by incorporating tenebrism, realistic models, and muted colors (except redish pink for some reason).
	- England: Joseph Wright of Derby (pg 780)
		- A Philosopher giving a Lecture on an Orrery, 1763-1765
		- TENEBRISM!!!
